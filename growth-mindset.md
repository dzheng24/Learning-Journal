## Welcome to David's Code 102 Learning Journal 


### Growth Mindset
Growth Mindset is the self-perception that you are not limited in your ability to learn, and to succeed.
These are some reminders to keep me in that *Growth Mindset*.
     -  Understand that challenges are supposed to be **hard**.
     -  Failing is part of the process to reach success; great athletes such as Michael Jordan have missed numerous game winning shots.
     -  Having the *Growth Mindset* will lead me to higher potential.
