# What is programming?

    -Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step.
    -A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page.
    -Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them. 

    -To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 
    - The computer needs to follow instructions every time it performs the task. So a program must give the computer enough detail to perform the task as if every time were its first time.

    -Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand and follow. 
        -Vocabulary: the words that computers understand.
        -Syntax: how you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow. 

# Expressions

An **expression** evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
1. expressions that just assign a value to a variable. ex. var color = 'beige';
2. expressions that use two or more values to return a single value. ex. var area = 3 * 2;

# Operators
-Expressions rely on things called **operators**; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 
-Some arithmetic operators are:
    - (+) addition
    - (-) subtraction
    - (/) division
    - (*) multiplication
    - (++) increment
    - (--) decrement
-**When you place quotes around a number, it is a string (not a numeric data type), and you cannot perform addition operatons on strings.**
-Programmers call the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string **concatenation**. 

# Function
-Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
-The statements in a function are not always executed when a page loads, so functions also offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve a task. 
-When you ask it to perform its task, it is known as **calling** the function. 
-**parameters** are pieces of information passed to a function. 
-**return value** is the response when you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer.
