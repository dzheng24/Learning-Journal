# HTML Basics 

HTML are the building blocks of a website. It focuses on the structure of a page, not the presentation. 

## Summary from Chapter 18:
    - It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
    - Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
    - Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
    - Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
    - You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
    - You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present. 

## Here are a quick summary from Chapter 1:
    - HTML pages are text documents.
    - HTML uses tags, which are characters that sit inside angled brackets. They act like containers and tell you something about the information that lies between them.
    - Tags are often referred to as elements. 
    - Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
    - Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
    - Attributes require a name and a value. 
    - To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go. 

## Summary from Chapter 17:
    - The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
        - the main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site
        - a header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page
    - The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
    - The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
    - When the <aside> element is used inside an <article> element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. 
    - When the <aside> element is outside of an <article> element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page. 
    - The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
