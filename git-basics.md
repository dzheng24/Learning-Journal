# Version Control before Git

Version Control- a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. 
By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified. 
DVCS- Distributed Version Control systems; DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.

# Git
Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project, called a commit, Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. 
Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files,such as accidentally lost data.
