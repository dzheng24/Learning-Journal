### Growth Mindset
Growth Mindset is the self-perception that you are not limited in your ability to learn, and to succeed.
These are some reminders to keep me in that *Growth Mindset*
    1. Understand that challenges are supposed to be **hard**
    2. Failing is part of success; great athletes like Michael Jordan have missed numerous game winning shots.
    3. Having the *Growth Mindset* will lead me to higher potential
