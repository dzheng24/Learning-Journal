## Summary from Chapter 10
   
    - The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element. 
    - Rules are made up of selectors and declarations. 
    - CSS rules usually appear in a separate document. 

## Summary from Chapter 11
    - There are 3 ways to specify any color in CSS.
        - RGB values; `ex. rgb (100,100,90)`
        - HEX codes; `ex. #ee3e80`
        - Color names; ex. DarkCyan
    - CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. 
    - It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color. 
    -CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
